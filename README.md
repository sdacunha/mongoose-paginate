# Credits
Initial inspiration for this project began with https://github.com/ExtraBB/typegoose-cursor-pagination. I forked this and soon realized there were a few gaps I wanted to cover (support for multiple sort fields, support for aggregation pipelines), and some different design choices needed to be made.
